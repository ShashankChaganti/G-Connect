            <h6>How is Civil Engineering involved in urban planning?</h6>
            <p>Civil Engineering plays a crucial role in urban planning by designing and implementing infrastructure projects that support sustainable development in urban areas. This includes transportation systems, water and sewage systems, waste management facilities, and green spaces. Civil engineers collaborate with urban planners to ensure efficient and safe utilization of land and resources.</p>

            <h6>What is structural engineering in Civil Engineering?</h6>
            <p>Structural Engineering is a sub-discipline of Civil Engineering that focuses on the design and analysis of structures to ensure they can withstand the forces and loads they may encounter during their lifespan. This includes buildings, bridges, dams, towers, and other infrastructure. Structural engineers use principles of mechanics, materials science, and mathematics to design safe and efficient structures.</p>

            <h6>What are the environmental considerations in Civil Engineering?</h6>
            <p>Environmental considerations in Civil Engineering involve minimizing the impact of infrastructure projects on the natural environment and promoting sustainable practices. This includes reducing carbon emissions, conserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, and managing waste and pollution. Civil engineers integrate environmental principles into the planning, design, and construction of projects to mitigate negative impacts and promote long-term environmental stewardship.</p>
