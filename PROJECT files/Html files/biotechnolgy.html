            <p>The Department of Biotechnology was established in the year 2002 to train students for the emerging Biotechnology industry. The department offers B. Tech. (Biotechnology), M. Tech. (Biotechnology), M. Tech. (Food processing technology) and Ph. D. (Biotechnology) programme. The curriculum of these programme has been designed and updated to train students in the engineering skills relevant for Biotechnology based industries as well as in the fundamentals of biological sciences, physical sciences and computational sciences. The strong emphasis on fundamentals enables flexibility of the curriculum at advanced stages. Students choose advanced electives based on their interest and the anticipated, rapidly changing requirements of the Biotechnology industry..</p>
